# ReinforcementLearning
Introduce the concepts of the reinforcement learning and keep tracking updates of the researches in reinforcement learning. At the mean time, I introduce the corresponding RL approaches implemented in the dialogue policy. At the end, I show some recommendations about the reinforcement learning and the dialogue policy.

## Tabular Reinforcement Learning
